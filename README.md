# Language Scraper

Scripts for generating conjugation and declension quiz data from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/).

Currently, scripts consist of a Python [Scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html) Spider. After install dependencies, (see requirements.txt) you can execute the `run.sh` script to generate data. Results are placed in appropriate CSV files in the `/output` directory.
